        VEGETARIAN CURRIES

        <summary><b>1. Paneer Butter Masala</b></summary>
        <p>It is known for its mildly sweet and spicy taste with the goodness of fresh cream and butter topping with
            moist paneer. It is one of the most common curries for most vegetarians and is prepared for lunch and dinner
            and served with freshly baked roti, chapati, naan, and even a choice of rice. with step-by-step photo and
            video recipe. Paneer-based meals and curries are essential dishes to many vegetarians for their protein
            offerings. It can be added to rice, bread, pizza, sandwiches, and even deep-fried snacks, but curries are
            the popular choice. Out of these paneer curries, the paneer butter masala recipe also known as paneer
            makhani is a popular choice for its sweet and spicy curry taste. we always assume that most North Indian or
            Punjabi curries use the same gravy base with the same technique and hence it must be easy to prepare. This
            has been one of the stereotypes, especially for paneer-based recipes or curries. Perhaps even during my
            initial days of culinary learning, I used to make all the paneer curries but named them differently as per
            the occasion. But trust me, there are so many subtle variations and nuances that go into each and every
            Punjabi curry which makes it unique and hence the unique names. For instance, in this recipe of butter
            paneer, the base is prepared with onion and tomato but is handled differently compared to matar paneer or
            Kadai paneer. In addition, there is a generous amount of butter and fresh cream used which makes it a mild
            sweet and spicy curry. Moreover, the spice addition is minimal and hence it is appreciated worldwide and not
            just in India.</p>

        <summary><b>2. Palak Paneer</b></summary>
        <p>I have always been a huge fan of paneer recipes especially the North Indian paneer curries for roti or
            chapati. But I have a special attachment to the palak paneer recipe and hence it is the most frequently
            prepared paneer recipe in my house. Perhaps it could be the colour and texture compared to the other curries
            which are either red or orange in colour. The creamy dark green color with soft and tender fried paneer
            cubes makes this dish lip-smacking gravy-based curry. Generally, this curry is mainly served with roti or
            naan, but I even enjoy it with rice and poori‘s too. Particularly, jeera rice and palak gravy are my
            personal favorites. I ensure to make this combo each time I end up preparing this palak curry. I would
            heavily endorse trying this combination and share your feedback in the comment section.

        <summary><b>3. Aloo kurma</b></summary>
        <p>A potato curry is a must at home on weekends. With this, there’s either poori, chapati or sometime even dosa.
            So, whenever I have some time at hand and also feeling a little fancy, I jazz up the potato curry into
            varieties. This Aloo Kurma is one of those.

            Just like any other Indian household, I must say that potato is quite a staple with me and my family as
            well. We never really get bored of it. It comes very handy whenever you’re short of other vegetables at
            home. Since the main ingredient in this Aloo Kurma are potatoes, this dish is popular with my folks too.

            The first look of this deep orangish, red colored Aloo Kurma will make you feel that it is high on the spice
            meter. But it actually isn’t, as I use the byadagi red chilies which just impart their hue to the curry
            without making it spicy. You can use another chili variety. In that case, reduce the number.</p>

        <summary><b>4. Brinjal Curry</b></summary>
        <p>This special recipe is not your ordinary brinjal curry, made simply with an onion-tomato base and some
            spices.

            While I have, of course, added those ingredients, I made a few key additions to more fully develop the
            flavors of this classic Indian dish: coconut, peanuts and sesame seeds.

            The quick addition of these three simple ingredients makes all the difference in the flavor of this
            delicious brinjal curry.

            I recommend mopping up those complex flavors with some flat breads like roti, naan, millet flatbreads like
            bajra bhakri or jowar bhakri, or my personal, quick and easy favorite, bread or pav (dinner rolls).</p>

        <summary><b>5. Tomato Dal</b></summary>
        <p>It is a simple and tasty lentil-based curry recipe prepared with a combination of juicy ripe tomatoes and
            toor dal. Tomato Pappu or Tomato Dal is a popular curry from the Andhra cuisine and is mainly served with
            hot steamed rice. Particularly the combination of rice, dal, ghee, and a spicy pickle is a popular choice in
            South India. It can also be an ideal choice for different types of roti, naan, and bread recipes.

            There are many different variations of Dal recipe across India. Tomato Pappu Dal is one variation from the
            South Indian cuisine. Typically the dal is made with tomatoes and onions with an optional sourness from
            lemon juice. However, the dal made in South India contains a lot of tamarind juice. This adds extra
            tanginess to make it a comfortable and complete curry. In addition, the garlic tempering helps in digestion
            and adds the required flavor and taste.</p>

        <summary><b>1. Chicken Curry</b></summary>
        <p>Chicken curries come in many styles depending on where they're from. South Indian variations are rich in
            aromatic spices and inevitably evoke memories of tangy tastes, like sour kokum fruit and sweet-and-tangy
            tamarind fruit, in a mixture tempered by the smoothness of coconut cream. Although each region adds its own
            local ingredients, all chicken curries share the usage of yogurt, cream, or coconut milk to thicken the dish
            and temper down the spices.

            This dish, while South Indian in origin, is a variation on a classic, with an emphasis on fragrant whole
            spices and a generous amount of delicious and silky gravy. For a more flavorful dish, we suggest using
            skinless bone-in chicken, but if chicken breast is all that you have on hand, use it. Just don't overcook
            it, as the pieces can dry out.

            This South Indian chicken curry is a great dish for entertaining and, as with most South Indian delicacies,
            it goes really well with simple, plain basmati rice and vegetables.

        <summary><b>2. Prawn Curry</b></summary>
        <p>To make this prawn dish, start with peeling the prawns. You can leave the tails intact if you like. I chose
            to peel the prawns completely to eliminate the messy process of peeling them later.

            The base of the curry is super simple. First, you make the delicious sauce and then cook the prawns in it
            alongside coconut milk. It’s a simple combination of sautéed onions, spices and tomatoes.

            To make the sauce, heat up a little oil in a pan, sauté some onions alongside ginger, garlic and green
            chilies, and then fry the spices. The spices include ground cumin, ground coriander, red chili powder and
            garam masala. The tomato paste adds a rich tangy flavor to this Indian prawn curry that really complements
            with the flavor of the prawns.

            Now the peeled prawns go in along with water and enough salt. Let this cook, covered, for about 5-10 minutes
            depending on the size of the prawns. Finally, pour in coconut milk and simmer for another 2 minutes.

            Add a sprinkle of coriander leaves if you like and spoon it over rice. Yum!

        <summary><b>3. Fish Curry</b></summary>
        <p>
            Fish curry and rice is a staple meal in Goa, very close to my idea of a perfect meal! Taking this humble
            meal several notches higher, is the Goan fish thali – a platter of sorts – which always comes with a piece
            of fried fish, a bowl of fish curry and a few vegetable sides, pickles and a digestive drink made with
            coconut milk. A Goan fish thali is nothing short of heaven on a platter.

            This South Indian Fish Curry is a homage to all the regional fish curry recipes that are so unique and
            special to southern parts of India. The gravy base is a medley of spices, tomatoes, coconut milk, and the
            tempering, which is added after the fish is simmered in the gravy, borrows from the style of cooking in
            Kerala (where my family originates from).

        <summary><b>4. Mutton Curry</b></summary>
        <p>
            The key to the flavour of Andhra Spicy Mutton Curry Recipe is the generous amount of coriander & curry
            leaves used in it. It just makes the dish totally different and exotic. This may also be because of the
            extra flavour in the older bones. Lamb is normally slaughtered so young that the bones are brittle whereas
            mutton has had the chance for the flavour to develop a bit more.

            Although the list of ingredients is long, the dish itself is not that cumbersome to make. We need to
            marinate the meat for 1 to 2 hours and then the actual cooking time could be reduced. Mutton can be cooked
            quickly, but it needs a fairly strongly acidic marinade, which helps to tenderise the meat. I use either
            yoghurt or lemon juice like the one today. The key is to leave it for a few hours at least. Given a chance,
            I would leave it marinated overnight but it’s always not the case…so proceed according to your available
            time!!

        <summary><b>5. Crab Curry</b></summary>
        <p>I use frozen crab for all my crab dishes (like my Black Pepper Crab) and it turns out pretty great. When I
            cook crab, I prefer to use less salt, since the meat by itself carries some salt from the sea. The curry
            tends to be a little extra spicy so that the masala permeates nicely into the crab. Don’t get me wrong, I
            love simple crab meat dipped in melted butter as much as the next person, but there is something divine
            about a spicy Indian crab curry that you can only understand once you’ve tried it.

            Crab is a bit high in cholesterol and sodium, but it’s a great source of protein and vitamin B12. That’s
            honestly enough for me to classify it as a healthy weekend lunch!

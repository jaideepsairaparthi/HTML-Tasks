<p>Java is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language" title=" In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language" title="A general-purpose language is a computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.

<p>Java gained popularity shortly after its release and has been a very popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" title="GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, and continuous integration." target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in the use of Java in recent years with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages" title="This list of JVM Languages comprises notable computer programming languages that are used to produce computer software that runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM).

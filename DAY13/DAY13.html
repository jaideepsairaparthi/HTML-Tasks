            <h4>Department of Central Library</h4>
            <p>Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College established in the year 1977 encourages every
                student to use the library that has been carefully built up since the inception of the college. At
                present this library has a stock of 75456 volumes with a 18692 titles of books and about 1061 back
                volumes of scientific and technical periodicals. The library also subscribed to over 127 National
                journals and 33 magazines and more than 4731 e-Journals like IEEE, ELSEVIER,ASCE, J-GATE Engg. and
                DELNET-IESTC The VRSEC library follows the open access system, encouraging the user to browse freely in
                the stock area. The Book Bank facility is available for SC/ST students.</p>
            <p>Information is an essential input to national development. The modern Library has great responsibility
                in harnessing and utilization of information. The library and information centers strive for high
                quality of library services which emphasis the actual delivery of information rather than actual
                delivery of documents for meeting their generic as well as specific needs of the users The Central
                Library is based on the objectives of the parent institution of VRSEC.</p>
            <p>Standard text books and books by authors of repute in all fields taught at the college are stocked. The
                college follows a policy of buying multiple copies of many of these books to make them available to a
                large number of students. There is no question of budget approval when it comes to the buying of books.
                Thus students are not likely to be handicapped for want of reference materials at any time.</p>

            <p>Presently, 100+ CISCO access points have been installed to provide 24×7 Wi-Fi facility in the entire
                Campus & Hostels. All the Access Points are Licensed.</p>
            <p>The high quality persistent bandwidth offers high speed and uninterrupted Internet connectivity from
                anywhere on the campus through the campus LAN & Wi-Fi with Load Balancing & Network Redundancy
                Technology. The Campus has 1Gbps OFC backbone support with underground cabling . All Departments have

            <p> Alumni Association of V.R. Siddhartha Engineering College had a modest beginning in late nineties and
                fortified its wings in 2003. The same year marked the period of standardization in terms of its
                registration as a society named as VR Siddhartha Engineering College Old Students Association
                {VRSECOSA}. The first alumni meet with a large participation was held in the college in the month of
                June 2003. From 2006, every year a grand Silver Jubilee event of respective passed out batch is being
                celebrated in the last week of December.</p>
            <p> Alumni Association of V.R.Siddhartha Engineering College, Kanuru initiated a scholarship programme
                “SIDDHARTHA SAHAAYA”. Under this programme, meritorious and economically poor students are being
                identified and selected in the first year of their Engineering programme. Each student is awarded
                Rs.15,000/- per year towards the living expenses and gets continued for four years of the programme.
                Siddhartha Sahaaya scholarships started with 7 students during the academic year 2009-10 reached 130
                students by the year 2018-19.</p>
